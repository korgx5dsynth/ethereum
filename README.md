# Q&A

These sets of questions is designed to measure natural understandings. Those who have worked on Javacard Smartcards can relate what a `nonce` is to 
the `sequence counter` I documented [here](https://ref.gitbook.io/notes/java-card/scp02).

- When a smart contract is deployed, describe how the address of the smart contract is derived?
- How does a wallet cancel a pending transacion?
- Describe the two gas limits
- Describe the two kinds of accounts
