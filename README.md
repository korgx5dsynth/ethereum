# Q&A

These were sets of questions I first asked myself and after which to a reasonable degree am able to find and understand their answers. Those who have worked on [Smartcards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_card) can relate what a `nonce` is to the `sequence counter` I documented [here](https://ref.gitbook.io/notes/java-card/scp02).

Ethereum concepts are built on top of pre-existing old concepts in cryptography and distributed computing. 

- When a smart contract is deployed, describe how the address of the smart contract is derived?
- How does a wallet cancel a pending transaction?
- Describe the two gas limits
- Describe the two kinds of accounts
- What is the purpose of the `init` field in a transaction
- How can you tell if a transaction is a smart contract deployment?
- What are the 3 major pieces inside a block?
- What is the hashing type used in Ethereum?
- What is the asymmetric cryptography type used in Ethereum?
- Describe the true (unsolved computer science problem) purpose of a gas?
- What are the kinds of rewards that a miner receives when it successfully mines a block?
- Explain something about EIP-1599
- How many bytes in an Ethereum account private key?
- Describe how an account address is derived from a private key
- Can a smart contract, by itself, create and sign a transaction?
